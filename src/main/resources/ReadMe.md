# EasyShop

## Description of the Project
    
This is the final capstone project in the pluralsight learn to code academy.
It is an e-commerce application for a company named EasyShop that allows you to search and filter through different categories and items.
I started this project with most of it pre-made, leaving me with Implementing features and Debugging to finish it out.
